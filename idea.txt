Typing Test Game: Day-1
-Let's see we have the idea right now, along with some feature's ideas in it.
-The first idea is that we will make a game in which balloons fly from bottom of the screen to top(using animations).
-Each balloon will have a word inside it and the baloon will disappear when you enter the word in given space correctly.(display=none)[There is a array and the word is poped out of it.][Also the words are pushed inside the array through an api which has all the words of English.][We may use an object instead of an array to make the propagation fast. Since player can enter anyword displayed on screen and we need fastest response time.]
-The space key is signal that player has input the word in the system and the word gets submitted(event listener).
-The system checks whether the input word is in the array, the array here has the words that are displayed on the screen.
-The balloons fly using animations.
-We have a SetTimeOut which pushs the word and ask the program to launch a balloon. The SetTimeOut time gets changed as the player progress. The time changing system is inside a setInterval which change the time every 10sec.(The higher the difficulty the less time in setInterval.)
-The easy option will have only small letter words, or capital words and the hard level has mixed ones. Super hard will have punctuations and number too.

Note-Made the balloon container with 50px width and 85px height
Note-The display screen is 498.4px wide and 556.5px high. Made 4.2px padding so that 490px is the display Screen.

Typing Test Game: Day-2
-Spawning balloons at random positions(width is changing) in such a way that they do not collide(overlap) each other is challenging. So I have an idea that use two things:
--Intersection observer API at the bottom of display container(exactly 85px above from bottom) to see whether a position is taken.
--I will randomly generate left offset for balloons and check whether the position is available or not.
--Whenever a balloon is created it will be given a random color, a random word and a random left offset these all configurations can be pushed in a object of objects...or we may make two object of objects(one for seeing whether the balloon is poped or not and other to see whether it has freed up the space or not.)

Typing Test Game: Day-3
-First I am thinking i should hard code and burst some balloons inside the display screen....
-That means some balloons will be present in the screen and i will just enter something and they will be displayed none.

Typing Test Game: Day-4
-Updated the scoreboard it adds points equal to number of alphabets in a word.
-If it has first Word capital it will add an extra point.
