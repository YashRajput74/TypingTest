Typing Test Game: Day-1
-Let's see we have the idea right now, along with some feature's ideas in it.
-The first idea is that we will make a game in which balloons fly from bottom of the screen to top(using animations).
-Each balloon will have a word inside it and the baloon will disappear when you enter the word in given space correctly.(display=none)[There is a array and the word is poped out of it.][Also the words are pushed inside the array through an api which has all the words of English.][We may use an object instead of an array to make the propagation fast. Since player can enter anyword displayed on screen and we need fastest response time.]
-The space key is signal that player has input the word in the system and the word gets submitted(event listener).
-The system checks whether the input word is in the array, the array here has the words that are displayed on the screen.
-The balloons fly using animations.
-We have a SetTimeOut which pushs the word and ask the program to launch a balloon. The SetTimeOut time gets changed as the player progress. The time changing system is inside a setInterval which change the time every 10sec.(The higher the difficulty the less time in setInterval.)
-The easy option will have only small letter words, or capital words and the hard level has mixed ones. Super hard will have punctuations and number too.

-This is the basic UI code which i will use later:

}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Made the balloon container with 50px width and 85px height
The display screen is 498.4px wide and 556.5px high. Made 4.2px padding so that 490px is the display Screen.
